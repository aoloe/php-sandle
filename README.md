Sandle is a way to pull together trivial^w tiny PHP libraries and create a "traditional" dynamic website.

Thanks to http://mrsharpoblunto.github.io/foswig.js/ for providing a name for this project.

## TODO

- have a  look at [Aura](http://auraphp.com/) and see which tools can be integrated... and get inspiration on how to present this project
- [Wardrobe](https://github.com/wardrobecms/wardrobe) a Markdown base CMS
